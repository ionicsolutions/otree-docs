Bots: advanced features
=======================

These are advanced features that are mostly unsupported in oTree Studio.

Command line bots
-----------------

An alternative to running bots in your web browser is to run them in the command line.
You will see each page submission printed in your command line window.
Let's say you have this session config:

.. code-block:: python

    dict(
        name='mysession',
        app_sequence=['ultimatum', 'survey'],
        num_demo_participants=1,
    ),

If each app in the ``app_sequence`` has bots, you can run them with::

    otree test mysession

To test with a specific number of participants
(otherwise it will default to ``num_demo_participants``)::

    otree test mysession 6

To run tests for all session configs::

    otree test

Exporting data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``--export`` flag to export the results to a CSV file::

    otree test mysession --export

To specify the folder where the data is saved, do::

    otree test mysession --export=myfolder


Command-line browser bots
-------------------------

You can launch browser bots from the command line, using ``otree browser_bots``.

-   Make sure Google Chrome is installed, or set ``BROWSER_COMMAND`` in ``settings.py``
    (more info below).
-   Run your server
-   Close all Chrome windows.
-   Run this::

        otree browser_bots mysession

This will launch several Chrome tabs and run the bots.
When finished, the tabs will close, and you will see a report in
your terminal window.

If Chrome doesn't close windows properly,
make sure you closed all Chrome windows prior to launching the command.

Command-line browser bots on a remote server (e.g. Heroku)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the server is running on a host/port other than the usual ``http://localhost:8000``,
you need to pass ``--server-url``.
For example, if it's on Heroku, you would do like this::

    otree browser_bots mysession --server-url=https://YOUR-SITE.herokuapp.com


Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

On my PC, running the default public_goods session with 3 participants takes about 4-5 seconds,
and with 9 participants takes about 10 seconds.

Choosing session configs and sizes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify the number of participants::

    otree browser_bots mysession 6

To test all session configs, just run this::

    otree browser_bots


Browser bots: misc notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use a browser other than Chrome by setting ``BROWSER_COMMAND``
in ``settings.py``. Then, oTree will open the browser by doing something like
``subprocess.Popen(settings.BROWSER_COMMAND)``.

(Optional) To make the bots run more quickly, disable most/all add-ons, especially ad-blockers.
Or `create a fresh Chrome profile <https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/142059?hl=en>`__
that you use just for browser testing. When oTree launches Chrome,
it should use the last profile you had open.

.. _cases:

Test cases
----------

You can define an attribute ``cases`` on your PlayerBot class
that lists different test cases.
For example, in a public goods game, you may want to test 3 scenarios:

-   All players contribute half their endowment
-   All players contribute nothing
-   All players contribute their entire endowment (100 points)

We can call these 3 test cases "basic", "min", and "max", respectively,
and put them in ``cases``. Then, oTree will execute the bot 3 times, once for
each test case. Each time, a different value from ``cases`` will be assigned to ``self.case``
in the bot.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from . import pages
    from otree.api import Bot, SubmissionMustFail


    class PlayerBot(Bot):

        cases = ['basic', 'min', 'max']

        def play_round(self):
            yield (pages.Introduction)

            if self.case == 'basic':
                assert self.player.payoff == None

            if self.case == 'basic':
                if self.player.id_in_group == 1:
                    for invalid_contribution in [-1, 101]:
                        yield SubmissionMustFail(pages.Contribute, {'contribution': invalid_contribution})
            contribution = {
                'min': 0,
                'max': 100,
                'basic': 50,
            }[self.case]

            yield (pages.Contribute, {"contribution": contribution})
            yield (pages.Results)

            if self.player.id_in_group == 1:

                if self.case == 'min':
                    expected_payoff = 110
                elif self.case == 'max':
                    expected_payoff = 190
                else:
                    expected_payoff = 150
                assert self.player.payoff == expected_payoff

``cases`` needs to be a list, but it can contain any data type, such as strings,
integers, or even dictionaries. Here is a trust game bot that uses dictionaries
as cases.

.. code-block:: python

    from . import pages
    from otree.api import Bot, SubmissionMustFail


    class PlayerBot(Bot):

        cases = [
            {'offer': 0, 'return': 0, 'p1_payoff': 10, 'p2_payoff': 0},
            {'offer': 5, 'return': 10, 'p1_payoff': 15, 'p2_payoff': 5},
            {'offer': 10, 'return': 30, 'p1_payoff': 30, 'p2_payoff': 0}
        ]

        def play_round(self):
            case = self.case
            if self.player.id_in_group == 1:
                yield (pages.Send, {"sent_amount": case['offer']})

            else:
                for invalid_return in [-1, case['offer'] * Constants.multiplication_factor + 1]:
                    yield SubmissionMustFail(pages.SendBack, {'sent_back_amount': invalid_return})
                yield (pages.SendBack, {'sent_back_amount': case['return']})

            yield (pages.Results)


            if self.player.id_in_group == 1:
                expected_payoff = case['p1_payoff']
            else:
                expected_payoff = case['p2_payoff']

            assert self.player.payoff == expected_payoff


.. _error_fields:

error_fields
------------

When using ``SubmissionMustFail`` on forms with multiple fields, you can
use ``error_fields`` for extra thoroughness.

For example, let's say we a submit a valid ``age``, but
an invalid ``weight`` and ``height``:

.. code-block:: python

    yield SubmissionMustFail(
        pages.Survey,
        dict(
            age=20,
            weight=-1,
            height=-1,
        )
    )

What's missing is that the bot system doesn't tell us exactly *why*
the submission fails. Is it an invalid ``weight``, ``height``, or both?
``error_fields`` can resolve the ambiguity:

.. code-block:: python

    yield SubmissionMustFail(
        pages.Survey,
        dict(
            age=20,
            weight=-1,
            height=-1,
        ),
        error_fields=['weight', 'height']
    )

This will verify that ``weight`` and ``height`` contained errors,
but ``age`` did not.

If :ref:`error_message <error_message>` returns an error,
then ``error_fields`` will be ``['__all__']``.

Misc note
---------

In bots, it is risky to assign
``player = self.player`` (or ``participant = self.participant``, etc),
even though that kind of code is encouraged elsewhere.

Because if there is a ``yield`` in between, the data can be stale:

.. code-block:: python

    from otree.api import expect

    player = self.player
    expect(player.money_left, c(10))
    yield pages.Contribute, dict(contribution=c(1))
    # don't do this!
    # "player" variable still has the data from BEFORE pages.Contribute was submitted.
    expect(player.money_left, c(9))

It's safer to use ``self.player.money_left`` directly,
because doing ``self.player`` gets the most recent data from the database.
